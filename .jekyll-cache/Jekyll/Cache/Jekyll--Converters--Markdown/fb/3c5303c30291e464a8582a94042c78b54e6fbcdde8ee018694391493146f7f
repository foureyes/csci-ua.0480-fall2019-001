  <h2 id="cloning-vs-init-and-push">Cloning vs init and push</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>previous instructions specified to clone</li>
    <li>those instructions were if you <em>actually</em> had stuff in the repository beforehand</li>
    <li>if your remote is empty&#8230; use the init and push workflow instead</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="multiple-github-accounts">Multiple GitHub Accounts</h2>

  <p>There may be a credential caching issue if you have more than 1 github account.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I believe you can fix this by changing your global .gitconfig.</li>
    <li>However, a fix that definitely works is to use SSH rather than HTTPS (you&#39;ll have to generate a key if you don&#39;t already have one&#8230; and add to your github settings)</li>
  </ul>
