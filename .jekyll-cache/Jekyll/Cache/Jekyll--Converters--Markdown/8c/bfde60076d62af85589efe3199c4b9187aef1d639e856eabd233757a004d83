  <p><strong><a href="../../homework/03.html">Homework #3</a> was posted yesterday, and is due next Tuesday</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">you should have your repositories with starter files</li>
    <li class="fragment">it&#39;s fairly different from the previous homeworks, so it&#39;ll be more stimulating/challenging (it incorporates material from objects/prototypes, higher order functions, socket programming, and http!)</li>
    <li class="fragment">however, the amount of code you write will likely be no more than homework #01</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fragment"><br />
Speaking of homework 01, grades should be posted by the end of this week.</p>

  <p><strong>Quizzes #2 (Oject Basics) and #3 (Objects and Prototypes) are due on Thursday.</strong> &#8594;</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">all about objects but split into two parts, with 17 questions total</li>
    <li class="fragment">first set is super easy; 7 questions</li>
    <li class="fragment">second set is slightly more challenging because it deals with prototypes; it has 10 questions, with some questions <strong>being very similar but with subtle differences</strong></li>
    <li class="fragment">please inform me of any issues regarding quizzes; one correction was already made (and quizzes regraded accordingly)</li>

  <p><a href="../../resources/img/survey.png">Here are some of the aggregate survey results</a></p>

  <p><strong>So, what does this mean?</strong> &#8594;</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">I&#39;ll adjust the pace of the lectures accordingly</li>
    <li class="fragment">but homework is very slightly on the easy side (which seems contradictory to above&#8230; though I think homework #03 will be adequately challenging and fun)</li>
    <li class="fragment">there some demand for a git tutorial, but not enough to devote an in-class lecture; i will do an out-of-class workshop</li>
    <li class="fragment">hm&#8230; for tutoring, i&#39;ll see what I can do about scheduling after 5pm tutoring hours</li>
  </ul>
